# Hi!ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to the bright place where I share my work.
## Monologue
Embarked on a journey into the unknown, where sometimes there seems to be nothing but darkness. The search at its end made known what was previously unknown, brought to light what previously dwelt in darkness.\
Everything happens in its time, good and bad things.\
Different conceptions of good and evil led people to do what is bad, believing that this would be for the good of all.\
I hope that in my journey as a software engineer, i don't end up becoming one of those people.
